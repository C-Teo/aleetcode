## LeetCode Solutions Repository 📕

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions Repository! This repository is dedicated to storing my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Whether you're a fellow coder looking for inspiration or just stumbled upon this repository by chance, feel free to explore and learn from the solutions provided here.

## Folder Structure 📁
The repository is organized by LeetCode problem topics, and within each topic, solutions are organized by problem number. The folder structure is as follows:

```
/SampleDirectory
    /AnotherDirectory
        - 1_two_sum.py
        - ...
    /DirectoryTwo
        - ...
    /SupriseAThirdDirectory
        - ...
    /...
```

Each file (e.g., 1_two_sum.py) corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem within the respective topic. The solutions are implemented in a specific programming language (usually if not always Python3) and may include comments explaining the thought process and any relevant concepts used. Time and Space complexity is also documented at the bottom of each file. Sometimes a file may have multiple solutions as I begin to study how to optimize the code.

## How to Use ❓
Feel free to navigate through the folders and explore the solutions. If you're facing a particular LeetCode problem, you can find it in the corresponding topic and review the solution implemented in the associated file.

## Contribution 🎁
While this repository is primarily a personal collection of solutions, I welcome contributions in the form of improved solutions, additional explanations, or corrections. If you have a better approach to solving a problem or want to add a solution in a different programming language, please open a pull request.

> Happy coding!
